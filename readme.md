# Gridlock

A tiny, simple and dynamic grid system.

[Example](http://codepen.io/nblackburn/full/PwNQQV)

## Introduction

Before you run away at the sight of yet another grid system, Gridlock was designed to be different because it puts you as it's focus point and as a result uses plain english class names and a simple structure to create the grids that you want. If you don't like something, change it to your liking and everything will continue to work at the change of a property.

```html
<div class="row">
	<div class="column-5">This is a column.</div>
	<div class="column-5">This is a column.</div>
</div>
```

> Providing your class names add up to that of the total columns, you can mix and match any amount of columns and widths you like.
